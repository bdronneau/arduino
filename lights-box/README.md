_Note_: One button switch die during the process, that's why there is four on the box but three wired

Pressing blue button or white button chaging leds pattern. The red button launch music on the buzzer (mario, star wars or christmas).

The "plane" switches are used for big LEDs.

The double switch button:

Alimentation is done by 12V and 9V (yes this can be optimize).
